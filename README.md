## üöÄ Project Overview

Solar energy is a powerful renewable resource. Understanding solar irradiance, climate conditions, and equipment performance is critical for optimizing energy production and deployment of solar technology.

This personal project is my analytical exploration of solar datasets from several countries (such as Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo). It involves detailed data profiling, exploratory analysis, statistical comparisons, and interactive visualizations to extract actionable insights.

## üìä Features & Analysis

This repository focuses on the following core areas:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

  - Analyzing solar radiation parameters (`GHI`, `DNI`, `DHI`), temperature, and sensor measurements.
  - Identifying and handling missing data, outliers, and anomalies.

- **Comparative Analysis**:

  - Evaluating solar potential across countries using statistical methods.
  - Providing comparative visualizations and highlighting regional differences clearly.

- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - A Streamlit-powered interactive dashboard for intuitive exploration of solar data.
  - Dynamic visualizations to easily compare solar potential, climatic influences, and sensor reliability.
